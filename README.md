# RSE_weather
MATLAB code to emulate Pokemon Ruby Sapphire and Emerald weather into a GIF. Can be used as overlay on top of your own custom RSE maps!

Simply run the matlab code for the weather type and include the corresponding image files. Parameters such as speed, quantity, image size, gif duration, and more can be changed at the top of the MALTAB file. 

Currently only rain is implement, but more is on the way!

Big thanks to @pret for providing the weather animations at https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/tree/master/graphics/weather
